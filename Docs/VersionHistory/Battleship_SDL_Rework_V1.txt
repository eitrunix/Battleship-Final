Battleship

My General Layout for my Rebulding of Battleship using my Old Game
Throw everything into Managers that hold the information, that can then pass that information around
Build the game and have that all running that fire off information
The UI will listen for the information and display depending on what it catches

Im trying to have the Game run in full, without interacting with the UI, and have the UI on work when it gets the information it wants


Classes

Pieces - Sets up the pieces Health, name, ID

Scoreboard - Printing the Scoreboard, getting refrence to the HealthManager to track the current hitpoints

HealthManager - Gets Health Values and sets them for the game, then use this to change values in game
	\\ Knows the total number of ships pieces to check for the win con, as well as if pieces are destroyed or not
